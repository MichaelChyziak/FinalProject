Version of function
ignore zeros vs calculate all
i = 715 ->2.82304833 vs 3.10647625 = slower by 0.28342792
i = 3393 ->14.78400167 vs 14.95798433 = slower by 0.17398266

about 10k, the calculate all version will become faster
therefore at 10k which is roughly 45seconds (less than a minute for sure) it will become faster
usually phones are on for more than a minute, therefore we use the calculate all version.
